# 🌸my Kisah Landing Page

A personal, emotionally-driven project showcasing Kaoruko Wakamiya from *Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku*. This is not just a web showcase—it's my story. Every section reflects my admiration and quiet identification with Kaoruko.

> This isn't a rushed or superficial creation. It's real. Please understand that.

## 💖 Why This Anime Means So Much

*Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku* resonates deeply with me because of Kaoruko's reserved nature, her silent strength, and the calm sadness behind her eyes. Her story echoes my own journey—quiet, complex, and often misunderstood. Watching her is like watching fragments of myself in motion.
